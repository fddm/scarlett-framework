* Install GruntJS by running "npm install -g grunt-cli" in your computer terminal
* Open a terminal in the root folder and execute "npm install" for dependency resolution

### Optional Setup ###

* To activate automatic project build on code change simply run "grunt dev" on the root folder. 
* To change the directory output of the build file, change the 'copyToDirectory' target in Gruntfile.js.
* To create a distribution file (minified and uglified) run "grunt dist"

### Recommended Code Editors ###

* IntelliJ Ultimate or Webstorm

### IntelliJ/Webstorm Users ###

This project uses the latest Ecma6 Javascript features and therefore if you are using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Webstorm it might detect code errors when using the default settings.

To allow Ecma6 syntax make sure to change the Javascript Version in the settings menu (Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> Javascript).

* Altough this project can be associated to the Scarlett-Editor, it can be used for standalone development (see /demos folder)
